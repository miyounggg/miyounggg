### Hi there 👋

<!--
**miyounggg/miyounggg** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a student studying in the AI department.
I'm taking a class related to GitHub in a subject called Open Source, so it's a new account.
My goal is to take classes hard and do my homework hard and get good grades!
